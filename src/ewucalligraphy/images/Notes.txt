	//The editTile is a duplicate that I can perform Transforms to later
	//WritableRaster editTile = myTile.createCompatibleWritableRaster();

	
	
	
	//NOTE: This can take lots of memory if the image is large
	//Also, this gives little informaiton,
	// each pixel becomes a number 0-255 *8-bit*
	//int[] emptyArray = null;
	// int[] pixelData = myTile.getPixels(0, 0,tileWidth, tileHeight, emptyArray);




	SampleModel: This class is generally a fall back method for dealing with images. More efficient code will cast the SampleModel to the appropriate subclass and extract the information needed to directly manipulate pixels in the DataBuffer.
